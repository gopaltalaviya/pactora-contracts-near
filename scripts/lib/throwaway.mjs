 * Throwaway test accounts, with no NEAR stranded on a key nobody holds.
 *
 * On the sandbox nothing is kept. On testnet every new account's key is written
 * to `.keys/<network>/<account id>.json` (gitignored) BEFORE the account is
 * created and funded. `sweep` later deletes each full-access test account with
 * the deployer (your own account) as beneficiary, which returns its whole
 * balance.
 *
 * Agent wallets hold ONLY a function-call key scoped to Pactora, and that is
 * the security property under test, so no key can ever move their NEAR. Their
 * key is saved too, they are funded with only what their calls burn, and the
 * sweep reports what they still hold.
